# CHRISMAPP
R script to annotate satDNAs in chromosome level assemblies


The pipeline needs an annotation step made in Geneious pro. The similarity we recommend is around 80-85 % (as a FISH stringency). Then you only need to run this script in R, providing also a .txt file containing chromosome names and the length of each one for plotting.
