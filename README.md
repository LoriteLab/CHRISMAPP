# CHRISMAPP
R script to annotate satDNAs in chromosome-level assemblies.


The pipeline needs an annotation step made in Geneious prime. The similarity we recommend is around 70%. You must to export an .gff file with only the annotations.
Then you only need to run this script in R, providing also a .txt file containing chromosome names and the length of each one for plotting.
